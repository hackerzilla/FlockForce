		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this assignment we implemented a cloth simulation from the ground up. We wrote code to initialize the particles (point masses) in a paramterized spatial configuration, create data structures for the springs that hold the cloth together, compute the per-frame Verlet integration in order to update the pointsâ€™ positions. We also wrote the code to detect collisions between the point masses and other objects in the scene, as well as a spatial hashing algorithm to approximately handle collisions between particles in an efficient manner. Finally we wrote GLSL shader code to perform GPU accelerated lighting calculations in order to give some much needed artistic character to the cloth.
